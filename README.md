# FBReactions

FBReactions is a python script to enable a user to save the usernames of people that have reacted to a specific post on Facebook, using the Firefox Add-On "Copy all links", other similar add-ons might work, but haven't been tested. 

It might be necessary to install tkinter on linux systems, like Buscador for example

If so, in the terminal type:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
With Facebook open, run the script and follow the instructions. FBReactions will copy the links directly from the clipboard.
